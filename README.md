# Features

### Universal DocumentDB and MongoDB Support

Connect to any MongoDB or DocumentDB instance: cloud, hybrid cloud, on-premises, or a local machine.

- **Flexible Connections:** Use a connection string or browse your cloud providers.

- **Cross-Platform Service Discovery:** Connect to DocumentDB and MongoDB instances hosted with your provider.

- **Wide Compatibility:** Full support for all DocumentDB and MongoDB API databases.

### Developer-Centric Experience

DocumentDB for VS Code focuses on providing developer productivity features with minimal setup.

- **Multiple Data Views**: Inspect collections using **Table**, **Tree**, or **JSON** layouts, with built-in pagination.

- **Query Editing**: Execute `find` queries with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and field name suggestions.

- **Document Management**: Create, edit, and delete documents directly from VS Code.

- **Data Import/Export**: Quickly import JSON files or export documents, query results, or collections.

### Open Development

We believe in building in the open. All development, roadmap planning, and feature discussions happen publicly on GitHub.
Your feedback, contributions, and ideas shape the future of the extension.

# Prerequisites

- **Mongo Shell Requirement (Optional)**: Some advanced commands in the Mongo [scrapbook](#mongo-scrapbooks), as well as use of the MongoDB shell, require installing [MongoDB shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues and limitations to be aware of when using the DocumentDB VS Code extension:

- **Escaped Characters in Scrapbooks**: Scrapbook support for escaped characters is preliminary. Use double escaping for newlines (`\\n` instead of `\n`).
