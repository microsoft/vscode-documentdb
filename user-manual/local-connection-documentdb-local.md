# DocumentDB Local

The **DocumentDB Local** option is designed to help you connect to a local instance of DocumentDB running on your machine. This is useful for development, prototyping, or testing scenarios where you want to work with DocumentDB without connecting to a remote or cloud-based instance.

## How to Use

- Ensure you have a local DocumentDB instance running on your machine.
- In DocumentDB for VS Code, select the **DocumentDB Local** option from the local connection area.
- The extension will guide you through the connection process, allowing you to specify connection details and adjust security settings as needed.
