# DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.1

We're happy to announce the **public release of the DocumentDB for VS Code Extension (v0.2.1)**, a dedicated VS Code extension designed specifically for developers working with **DocumentDB** and **MongoDB** databases. This new extension focuses on connection management and developer productivity right within VS Code.

Our mission is to provide a reliable, cloud-agnostic, cross-platform tool for managing MongoDB and DocumentDB databases directly from your development environment.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dedicated to DocumentDB and MongoDB Databases**

The **DocumentDB for VS Code** extension is designed specifically to manage **MongoDB** and **DocumentDB** databases, without being tied to any particular cloud provider:

- **Cloud-agnostic**: Connect easily to MongoDB-compatible databases running locally, on-premises, or in cloud environments like Azure Cosmos DB, MongoDB Atlas, AWS DocumentDB, or others.
- **Cross-platform**: Provides a consistent experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Comprehensive Control**: Manage and configure database connections directly from VS Code.

Our goal is simple: to enhance your productivity by integrating useful database management features directly into your workflow in VS Code.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Extensible with Service Discovery Providers**

This release introduces two new **Service Discovery Providers**, making it easier to find and manage your database resources:

- **Azure Virtual Machines Provider**: Automatically identifies MongoDB-compatible databases running on your Azure VMs.
- **Azure Resource Provider**: Integrates with the Azure Resources extension to discover DocumentDB and MongoDB databases available in your Azure subscriptions.

These providers help reduce manual configuration so you can focus more on your data and applications.
