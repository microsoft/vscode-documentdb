# DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.2

We're excited to share the release of **DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.2**, continuing our mission to bring powerful MongoDB and DocumentDB development capabilities into your daily VS Code workflow. This update brings **significant improvements to data import performance**, **new extension-to-extension integration capabilities**, and **a more polished user experience**, particularly around connection management and service discovery.

Whether you're working with **MongoDB**, **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB**, or **DocumentDB-compatible databases** across different environments, this version focuses on enabling you to work **faster, more reliably, and with greater flexibility**.

## What‚Äôs New in v0.2.2

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Preview of Data Migration Plugin Support**

We're introducing an **experimental data migration framework** that enables third-party extensions to provide migration tooling through the DocumentDB extension. Built on a provider-based architecture, it offers:

- A shared API surface for data movement between databases, clouds, or local setups.
- Rich context-aware workflows that pass database and collection info directly to the provider.
- Custom UI integration, authentication handling, and progress tracking.

This is an opt-in preview aimed at extension authors and early adopters. [Learn how to participate in the preview ‚Üí](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-documentdb/data-migrations)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **URL Handler for Direct Database Navigation**

You can now use custom `vscode://` URLs to **deep-link into your database environments** directly from documentation, apps, bookmarks, or team workflows. These links can:

- Connect to a specific MongoDB or DocumentDB instance.
- Automatically open a database or even a collection within the extension.
- Support shared workflows and fast switching between environments.

This is a major step toward tighter integration with other tools and improved developer ergonomics. [Read full URL syntax and examples ‚Üí](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-documentdb/)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Buffered Document Importing for Faster Performance**

Importing documents is now significantly faster thanks to **buffered bulk insert support**. This change:

- Speeds up large imports by reducing the overhead of one-document-at-a-time writes.
- Offers smoother progress and reduces chances of timeout for many scenarios.
- Is temporarily disabled for Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (RU-based) due to resource throttling concerns ‚Äî full support is planned after improvements to resource detection.

## Key Fixes and UX Improvements

### ‚úÖ Smarter and Safer Connection Management

- **Duplicate connection strings are now detected**. Instead of silently ignoring or duplicating entries, users are clearly notified.
  [#88](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/88)
- **VM Discovery flow now supports port customization**. You can specify a custom MongoDB port during Azure VM connection.
  [#85](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/85)
- **Improved connection feedback after login** in the Azure Service Discovery flow ‚Äî users are now shown confirmation and guided next steps, removing ambiguity.
  [#91](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/91)
- **Challenge confirmation dialogs on macOS fixed** ‚Äî previously, both ‚Äúdefault‚Äù and ‚Äúactive‚Äù states could be triggered together, leading to accidental confirmations.
  [#128](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/128)

### UI and Interaction Polish

- **Disabled misleading Cut/Copy/Paste context menu entries** in Table and Tree views where editing is not available. This prevents user confusion and accidental no-ops.
  [#81](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/81)
- **Resolved CodeLens duplication in Mongo Shell issue** that occurred when both this extension and the Azure Databases extension were installed. Now, query actions are cleanly rendered with no runtime conflicts.
  [#109](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/109)
