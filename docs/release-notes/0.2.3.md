# DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.3

We're pleased to announce **DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.3**, a focused maintenance release that addresses key user feedback and modernizes the extension's foundation. While this is primarily a stability and maintenance update, we've included an important **connection management enhancement** that users have been requesting through feedback.

## What’s New in v0.2.3

### ⭐ **Smart Connection Focus and Highlighting**

Based on direct user feedback about managing multiple connections, we've introduced **smart connection focus behavior** that makes working with large connection lists much more intuitive:

- **New connections are automatically selected and focused** in the Connections View, eliminating the need to hunt for your newly added connection.
- **Existing connections are highlighted** when you attempt to add a duplicate, showing you exactly where the existing connection is located in your list.
- **Works across all connection methods** — whether you're adding connections via connection strings or through the Service Discovery View.

This enhancement is particularly valuable for developers managing many database connections, where custom connection names can make it unclear whether a connection already exists. Instead of just showing a generic "connection exists" message, the extension now **visually guides you to the exact connection**, saving time and reducing confusion.

## Under the Hood: Foundation Improvements

### 1️⃣ **Enhanced Connection String Handling**

We've updated the connection string parsing logic to better handle **complex passwords with special characters**. This addresses edge cases where certain password formats could cause connection failures, particularly when using the URL handler for deep-linking scenarios.

### 2️⃣ **Robust JSON Schema Handling**

We've improved the JSON schema handling within our "Collection View" to prevent errors caused by rapid refresh actions. By introducing better request management, we now gracefully handle concurrent schema updates.

### 3️⃣ **Modernized Development Stack**

This release includes significant updates to the extension's development foundation:

- **Updated dependency stack** with removal of obsolete packages for improved security and performance
- **Modernized ESLint and Prettier configurations** using the latest flat config formats
- **Upgraded to TypeScript ES2023 target** for better Node.js 20+ compatibility

These improvements ensure the extension remains maintainable and secure while providing a solid foundation for future feature development.
