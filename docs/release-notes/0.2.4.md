# DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.4

We're pleased to announce **DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.2.4**, a focused update that enhances query capabilities and improves the developer experience based on direct user feedback. This release introduces support for querying with BSON types like `UUID`, `Date`, `MinKey`, and `MaxKey`, and ensures these types are displayed correctly throughout the UI.

## What’s New in v0.2.4

### ⭐ **Enhanced BSON Type Support for Queries and Display**

Responding to a user requests, this release introduces robust support for querying and displaying complex BSON data types. This enhancement addresses a critical workflow limitation.

- **Query by `UUID`, `Date`, `MinKey`, and `MaxKey`**: You can now use constructor-like syntax directly in the find query bar to filter documents based on these BSON types.
- **Improved Data Display**: These special BSON types are now rendered in a human-readable format in both the tree and table views, making it easier to inspect your data at a glance.

This feature was fast-tracked thanks to direct customer feedback and unblocks key scenarios for users whose data models rely on UUID-based identifiers or date-based filtering. Further improvements to our query and scrapbook experience are planned as part of our work on [shell integration (#66)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/66), which is currently scheduled for a future release (0.5.0).

#### **Query Examples**

Here are a few examples of how you can use the new query syntax:

- **Find a document by its UUID:**
  ```json
  { "userId": UUID("123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000") }
  ```
- **Find documents with an exact creation date:**
  ```json
  { "createdAt": Date("2023-10-26T10:00:00.000Z") }
  ```
- **Find documents created after a specific date using the `$gt` operator:**
  ```json
  { "loginDate": { "$gt": Date("2023-01-01") } }
  ```

## Under the Hood: Foundation Improvements

### 1️⃣ **Modernized Azure Integration**

We have migrated our Azure discovery mechanism to use the new `@azure/arm-mongocluster` package. This update improves the reliability and performance of discovering Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) and other DocumentDB resources.

### 2️⃣ **Automated Release Pipeline**

To simplify our release process and enhance security, we have updated our build pipelines to automatically sign the extension. This is a key step towards fully automating our releases to the VS Code Marketplace, ensuring that updates are delivered faster and more securely.
