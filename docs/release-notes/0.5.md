# DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.5

We are excited to announce the release of **DocumentDB for VS Code Extension v0.5.0**. This update significantly enhances security and multi-tenant workflows with improved Microsoft Entra ID support, introduces a new "Help and Feedback" view, and delivers several key bug fixes to improve stability and user experience.

## What's New in v0.5

### ⭐ Enhanced Microsoft Entra ID Support for Multi-Account and Multi-Tenant Scenarios

Continuing our focus on enterprise-grade security from release 0.3.0, we have overhauled our Microsoft Entra ID integration to fully support multi-account and multi-tenant environments. This enables uninterrupted workflows for developers working across different organizations and directories.

- **Multi-Account Management**: You can now sign in with multiple Azure accounts and easily switch between them without leaving VS Code. A new **Manage Credentials** feature allows you to view all authenticated accounts and add new ones on the fly.
- **Multi-Tenant Filtering**: For users with access to multiple Azure tenants, a new filtering wizard lets you select exactly which tenants and subscriptions should be visible in the Service Discovery panel. Your selections are saved and persisted across sessions, ensuring a clean and relevant view of your resources.
- **Consistent Context**: The extension now correctly respects the tenant context associated with each resource, resolving previous inconsistencies and ensuring a reliable experience when interacting with clusters across different tenants.

This work was completed as part of PR [#277](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/pull/277) and addresses the following issues: [#285](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/285), [#284](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/284), [#265](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/265), [#243](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/243)

For more details, please see our new documentation on [Managing Azure Discovery (Accounts, Tenants, and Subscriptions)](../user-manual/managing-azure-discovery.md).

### ⭐ New "Help and Feedback" View

We've added a new **Help and Feedback** view to the extension sidebar, providing a central place to access important resources. This view makes it easier than ever to get help, provide feedback, and stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

The new view includes quick links to:

- **Documentation**: Access the full user manual.
- **Changelog**: See what's new in the latest release.
- **Report an Issue**: Quickly file a bug report on GitHub.
- **Request a Feature**: Share your ideas for new features.
- **Join the Discussion**: Connect with the community on our GitHub discussion board.

This feature was introduced in PR [#289](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/pull/289).

## Key Fixes and Improvements

- **Users are asked to re-enter password when launching the shell ([#285](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/285))**
  - Fixed a regression where users with saved credentials were still prompted for a password when launching the shell. The original functionality has been restored.

- **Service Discovery + Entra ID implementation does not use tenant information ([#276](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/276))**
  - Resolved an issue where the extension would fail to respect the tenant context when interacting with Azure resources from a non-default tenant. The extension now correctly handles tenant information, preventing inconsistent states.

- **Updating connection authentication from EntraID to UserName/Password fails ([#284](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-documentdb/issues/284))**
  - Corrected a failure that occurred when updating a connection's authentication method from Entra ID to a username/password. The connection now updates and connects successfully.
